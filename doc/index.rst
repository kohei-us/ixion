Ixion library documentation
===========================

Ixion is a general purpose formula parser, interpreter, formula cell dependency
tracker and spreadsheet document model backend all in one package.  You can use
Ixion to build a formula engine backend with spreadsheet-like multi-sheet cell
storage management, or simply to parse and tokenize formula expressions.
